# NOTES_CLI

## node version

node version: v20

## arg inconsistency

-V vs -h capital vs lowercase

## Local vs normal wallet

Not sure what the difference is between a local wallet and a normal wallet

## Alias-amount

Not intuitive what Alias-amount is supposed to mean

## Secret key is exposed

## Mnemonic is exposed

## No password not allowed

## Scenario 1 oddly phrased

> create fund an account

## kadena account fund

instead of showing help it throws an error

## kadena wallet generate-keys vs kadena keys generate

What is the difference and how are you supposed to use the keys generate?

## fund on mainnet? :o

## I like custom predicate :D

## Not easy to copy account name

## kadena tx --help provides commands in "non sorted order"

## add is not aligned :( in --help for tx

## template does not allow for own account selection
