# Kadena CLI Feedback

## Scenario

Add a New Wallet and Fund an Account on Testnet

## Participants

Driver: Ghislain & Kristina

Reporter: Ghislain & Kristina

## Expectations

I wanted to create a wallet

## Outcome

- The driver got confused when having to enter the password confirmation (mostly by the wording) => Confirm password
- The program terminated when typing in non-matching passwords
- Unclear if the generated keypair is only shown in the terminal or also saved to a file?
- The password for creating the keys, is this the same password as for the wallet?
- Driver is confused if he should use Account or Transaction to transfer-create the account.
- create only usable on mainnet?

- Feels a bit odd that I have to select a keyset predicate when only providing 1 public key:
