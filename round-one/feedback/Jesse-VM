## Scenario

## Participants

Driver: Jesse Van Muiden

Reporter: Mohamed Ismail


## Outcome

[Did the driver successfully complete the scenario?] - Yes

[Was it complex to execute] - Medium. it's not so easy.

[Did you have any prior knowledge about Kadena blockchain interactions] - BAsed on prior knowledge, it's easy to navigate

## Challenges
1. Funding an account is not clear, checking the wallet command. Since I created an wallet. WHere does the wallet ends where account starts was not very clear.

## Additional Feedback

1. Enter a password to verify with password - copy is not clear
2. When creating a wallet, if the keys are auto generated, it would be good.
3. Maybe default option as publickey and secret key when generating keys
4. "Enter a password"(implies enter new password) copy in the generate-keys command is not clear
5. After fund account, it would be good to have a help text on what to do next(check balance)

## Errors

No errors- warning 'punny code' module is deprecated

## Reflection

[Was the outcome as expected? Reflect on any differences between your expectations and the actual outcome.]

I able to achieve the expected outcome but it was not very clear on how to fund the account. I had to check the wallet command to see if there is any command to fund the account. It would be good to have a clear command to fund the account.

Liking:
1. The help text like what to do next is useful
