## **Scenario 1: Add and Fund Accounts on Testnet**

**Expectations**
The account is created on a certain network and it is confusing how accounts are related to networks.
kadena account create to create a keyset for you or to require a fungible account name.

**Outcome**

[Did the driver successfully complete the scenario?]
Yes

[Was it complex to execute]
Moderately

[Did you have any prior knowledge about Kadena blockchain interactions]
Yes

**Challenges**

I had to create a new wallet to add an extra account.
Using the first key from the wallet to create a new account with did not work.

**Additional Feedback**

kadena accounts create docs indicate that it creates an account on mainnet.
kadena accounts details should not ask you for the network the account is on.
I would like to see details of all of my accounts at once.
The relation between keys, accounts and wallets is a bit obscure.
It would be nice if the add-from-wallet command could create a key for you instead of having to select an existing one.
